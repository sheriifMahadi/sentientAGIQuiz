        Mission 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sentient‚Äôs mission is to ensure <strong>AGI remains loyal to humanity</strong>, not corporations.
        Centralized AI development today concentrates power in a few companies, creating risks over
        how AI is trained, who it serves, and which values guide it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúLoyal AI‚Äù means <strong>AI that is community-built and community-owned</strong>. It is not controlled
        by shareholders or governments, but by people. The belief is that <strong>all of humanity</strong>
        should benefit from AGI, not just a select few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Closed AI models often lack <strong>transparency and accountability</strong>, making them hard to trust.
        Centralized AI can unfairly influence <strong>global governance, healthcare, and journalism</strong>.
        Sentient aims for AI aligned with <strong>community values</strong>, not corporate profits.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "40px", marginBottom: "15px" }}>
        The Big Problem 
      </h2>
      <p>
        The danger of <strong>closed-source AGI</strong> is that only a handful of corporations, such as
        <strong> OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic</strong>, control it. These groups decide what AGI knows and who it serves.
      </p>
      <p>
        This creates systems aligned with <strong>corporate agendas</strong>, not community ethics.
        A few corporations holding AGI power is a <strong>fundamental threat to society</strong>, as it risks monopoly
        over knowledge, truth, and decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Closed models never provide <strong>community ownership</strong>. Development in these companies
        is often <strong>secretive and unaccountable</strong>, contrasting with open ecosystems
        where people can inspect, improve, and share technology.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "40px", marginBottom: "15px" }}>
        Vision 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sentient defines AGI not as one massive model, but as a <strong>network of specialized intelligences</strong>.
        These models and agents together form <strong>Sentient AGI</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone in the community can build models and agents, not just Sentient engineers. This makes
        Sentient AGI the first that is truly <strong>open and community-built</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approach is unique because it combines <strong>openness</strong> (transparent, collaborative)
        with <strong>commercial potential</strong> (utility, sustainability, revenue).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this framework, <strong>loyalty</strong> means:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Alignment</strong> ‚Äî AI aligns with human values</li>
          <li><strong>Ownership</strong> ‚Äî the community owns it</li>
          <li><strong>Control</strong> ‚Äî the community directs it</li>
        </ul>
        Ultimately, <strong>the community</strong>, not corporations or governments, should control AGI.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "40px", marginBottom: "15px" }}>
        The Grid 
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Grid</strong> is how Sentient makes the ecosystem function in practice.
        Like a power grid that distributes electricity, the Grid distributes <strong>intelligence</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual AI agents plug into the Grid, contributing their specialized skills. Users can access
        these agents as one seamless, coordinated system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Grid also acts as a <strong>distribution network</strong>, connecting users who want AI tools
        with the creators who build them. Revenue from usage flows back to creators,
        creating a <strong>self-sustaining community economy</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Grid ensures intelligence is <strong>interconnected, accessible, and continuously improving</strong>,
        rather than locked in closed corporate systems.
      </p>
